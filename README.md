# Java with SpringBoot + Maven Quickstart

Project startup with Docker, Java and Spring Boot + Maven.

The goal of this project is to have a local environment where it is possible to build, run the Spring Boot-CLI and run the application from the command line.

In other words, you will have to manually setup your IDE and integration with JDK.

Besides this, with the default configuration, the `.m2` folder will be shared between the host machine and the Docker container and will be cached in multiple runs.
